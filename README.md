- 👋 Hi, I’m @MissElysea!

- 👀 I’m interested in learning ALL things code!
- 🌱 I’m new to tech, but definitely not a rookie.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with others to become more knowledgeable on different programming languages, and to possibly network.
- 📫 Reach out to me on LinkedIn @Elysea Crawford I could use new connections.
