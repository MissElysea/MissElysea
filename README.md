# Hi, I'm @@ Elysea! 👩🏽‍💻👋🏽

I'm a Software Engineer, and I've got skills in developing killer full-stack web applications. You name it, I can build it! From the back-end magic with Node.js and Express.js to creating mind-blowing user interfaces using React.js, I've got it covered.

But hey, I'm not just about coding. I know the power of connections and the importance of staying in the loop. That's why I'm all about LinkedIn! I'm super stoked to connect with awesome professionals in the industry. Let's share knowledge, team up on exciting projects, and keep up with the fast-paced software engineering community. Let's create some serious magic together!
